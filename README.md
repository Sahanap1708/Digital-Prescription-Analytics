# 🏥 Digital Prescription Analytics System

A CLI-based ETL and Healthcare Analytics project built using Python, MySQL, and Matplotlib.

This project extracts prescription data from CSV files, applies business validation rules, loads clean data into MySQL, and generates analytical insights using SQL and Matplotlib dashboards.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system implements:

- End-to-end ETL pipeline
- Data cleaning and validation using business rules
- MySQL database design with constraints
- SQL-based analytics
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

---

## 📂 Dataset Files

The project uses the following CSV files:

- `patients_1000.csv`
- `doctors_1000.csv`
- `medicines_1000.csv`
- `prescriptions_1000.csv`

These files simulate real-world healthcare prescription data.

---

## 🧠 Business Rules Implemented

- Age must be between 0–100
- Duplicate prescriptions are removed
- Prescriptions without valid patient/doctor are rejected
- Missing dosage/frequency → "Not Provided"
- Unknown gender → "U"
